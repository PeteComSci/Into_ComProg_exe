# Understanding Functions

**Objective:** Learn to write and use functions in Python, focusing on a function that calculates the area of a rectangle.

---

**Instructions:**
1. Write a function in the script called `calculate_area` in `area_calculator.py` file.
    - The function should take two parameters: `length` and `width`.
    - It should return the area of the rectangle (length \* width).
2. Call the function with different values for length and width and print the results.
3. Consider and document your thoughts on the following questions:
    - What happens if you input negative numbers?
    - How might you modify the function to handle incorrect or negative input?

**Expected Output:** The program should correctly calculate and print the area of a rectangle given various lengths and widths.
