# Exploring Basic List Operations

**Objective:** Learn to perform basic operations on lists in Python, such as adding, removing, and accessing elements.

---

**Instructions:**
1. Create a Python script named `list_operations.py`.
2. In the script, create a list named `gadgets` containing names of tech gadgets.
3. Perform the following operations and print the list after each operation:
   - Add a new gadget to the list.
   - Remove a gadget from the list.
   - Access and print a specific gadget from the list by its index.
4. Reflect on what happens if you try to access or remove an element at an index that doesn't exist.

**Example Operations:**
- `gadgets.append("Smartwatch")` (to add)
- `gadgets.remove("Tablet")` (to remove)
- `print(gadgets[1])` (to access)

**Expected Output:** The program should demonstrate adding, removing, and accessing elements in a list.
