# Understanding Basic Conditional Statements

**Objective:** Learn and implement `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements in Python to determine if a number is positive, negative, or zero.

---

**Instructions:**
1. Write a Python program named `number_checker.py`.
2. The program should prompt the user to enter an integer.
3. Based on the input, the program should print:
   - "Positive" if the number is greater than zero.
   - "Negative" if the number is less than zero.
   - "Zero" if the number is exactly zero.

**Expected Output:** The program should correctly identify and output whether the input number is positive, negative, or zero.

**Note:** Focus on implementing the conditional logic correctly. Handle the input as an integer.
